## Case study 3: Data visualisation

This project looks at inequality in tech companies. It examines inequality primarily by gender and race, and looks at the pay gaps that exist between different groups at top tech companies. 

The project is built primarily with Javascript and is helping me get familiar with data visualisation techniques with this language.
